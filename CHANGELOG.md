  * Fix and document MCLK phase issue found on raspberry pi 3b

## 5.3.0

  * Fix setup_dac.py script for XVF3615
  * Build I2S slave drivers for UA XVF3610 setup

  * Fix bug in parsing of device names
  * Install one Debian package at the time

## 5.0.0

  * Added support for xvf3610-ua and xvf3615-ua
  * Renamed xvf3615 device as xvf3615-int
  * Renamed xvf3610 device as xvf3610-int

## 4.3.1

  * Fix comments and reg names in setup_dac.py

## 4.3.0

  * Added support for xvf3610 EVK board
  * Removed support for xvf3610 development board

## 4.2.0

  * Added support for xvf3600.
  * Renamed I2S_CLK_DAC_SETUP flag to include I2S master configurations

## 4.1.0

  * Added support for xvf3610.

## 4.0.0

  * Change supported command line arguments. Instead of vocalfusion for 3100, nothing for 3500, and vxf3510 for 3510, arguments are now xvf3100 for 3100, xvf3500 for 3500, and xvf3510 for 3510.
  * Internal changes to support adding future products.

## 3.0.0

  * Update clock dividers for RPi3 to generate a 12.288MHz clock, since the RPi4 clock at 24.576MHz has glitches
  * Add support for RPi4 on I2S loader kernel module
  * Add delay in loading I2S drivers needed for Buster on RPi3
